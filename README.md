# Metropolis algorithm for 2D Ising model with OpenCL

<sub><sup>Note: This code is based on [some examples](https://github.com/rsnemmen/OpenCL-examples/) I found online.</sup><sub>

To run, first build the program with make:

```
cd ./src/
make
```

That will create a file ising.out which is the main executable.
